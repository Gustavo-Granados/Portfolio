Hobby Project 
We will be doing a larger project at the end of this unit and it will involve a hobby that you do or find interesting. You will need to have pictures that you took yourself of either you or a friend doing that hobby. I will remind you every day but you can’t forget your pictures for the project. Get started today.

Choose 2-5 school appropriate hobbies and make a website about it.
