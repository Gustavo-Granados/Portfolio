                    Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.
                    It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. (TSR). The game has been published by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) 
                    since 1997. It was derived from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game Chainmail serving as the initial rule system. D&D's publication is 
                    commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry.<br>
                    <br>
                    D&D departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation. 
                    These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, 
                    while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world. The characters form a party 
                    and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, and gather treasure and knowledge.
                    In the process, the characters earn experience points (XP) in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming 
                    sessions.
