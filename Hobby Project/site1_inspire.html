                    <blockquote>
                <p>I got into Video Games when I was 8 years old, playing WII Sports
                    on the Nintendo WII in my basement at the time. I was always 
                    facinated by how a button I pressed or a movement I made could 
                    effect what happened on the screen. Though I must say that most 
                    of my experience at the time came from going to a friends house, 
                    where he was allowed to play for longer and owned more games than 
                    I did. This was around the time when the massive indie game MineCraft was 
                    launched, and from then on I played any game I could get my hands on. The 
                    main contributors to this interest were the hordes of Gaming Youtubers. People who  
                    recorded themselves playing games I liked while providing what was considered 'comedic commentary' at 
                    the time. In recent times I've narrowed down my preference, and play a handful of games that I've
                    enjoyed for a while. Overall, this has been my longest lasting hobby that I 
                    can enjoy whenever I think about it.
