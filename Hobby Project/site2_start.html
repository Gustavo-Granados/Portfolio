                <p>To get into the activity of airsoft, you need to have a understanding of your 
                    ability to run around a field in your equipment while looking out for 
                    enemy players.

                            <p>Every field has it's own set of rules, but here 
                                are some regulations that organized locations 
                                should have;

                                <li>Do not use a weapon on the fully-automatic settings if in close quarters</li>
                                <li>Guns should shoot at the appropriate speeds for the environment</li>

                            <blockquote>
                                <p>Though it is a rule that if you get shot you are out, since the pellets
                                    normally do not leave marks, it is very simple to cheat. Simply pretending not to feel 
                                    a BB is a common practice, and there is an equally effective way to counteract cheating. 
                                    Unless the individual puts their hand up or calls themselves out, just keep shooting. Though it 
                                    is easy to brush off one BB hitting them, not many people can get hit twenty times without 
                                    flinching. It seems like a harsh punishment, but as long they don't call themselves out, they are 
                                    still a player who needs to be hit.
