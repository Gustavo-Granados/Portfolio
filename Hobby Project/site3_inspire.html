                    <blockquote>
                <p> I started playing chess when I first moved to Arizona as a pass-time 
                    when I was not allowed to play Video Games. Although I used it as a 
                    filler hobby, I enjoyed it just the same as anything else I was doing 
                    at the time. When I visited my grandpa in California he offered to play 
                    a game against me for fun. He of course, beat me any time I tried to 
                    play him. From that point on I had a purpose, to defeat the grandparent that 
                    had bested me in a game that I only played in my free time. Currently I have 
                    not beaten him yet, but the thought that one day I will keeps me determined.
