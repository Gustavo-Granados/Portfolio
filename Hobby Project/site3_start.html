                <p>To get into chess, the only thing a person really needs is to know 
                    how to play. Some call them rules, but considering they're required 
                    to play the game, I consider them the 'physics' of chess.

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>A chess board has 16 pieces on each side of the board, with 6 unique pieces that 
                            have different physics. Here is a list of the pieces in order of value from 
                            least to greatest. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pawn</li>
                                <li>Knight</li>
                                <li>Bishop</li>
                                <li>Rook</li>
                                <li>Queen</li>
                                <li>King</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>     
                        <p>To understand the value of these pieces, these are some definitive movements 
                            that differentiate each piece.
                            <div>
                            <ul style="list-style: none">
                                <li><u>Pawns</u></li>
                                <ul style="list-style: none">
                                    <li>The pawns are the pieces that 
                                        start on the frontlines of the board,
                                        and are regularly considered 'cannon-fauter'. If a 
                                        pawn is making it's first move, it can move two spaces forward 
                                        instead of one space. Though this is optional and may only be used 
                                        on the pieces first move. 
                                        They can only move forward once per turn and only attack diagonally. 
                                        When taking a piece with a pawn, the pawn will take the 
                                        place of the original piece. Each side starts with 8 pawns.


                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                    <li><u>Knights</u></li>
                                    <ul style="list-style: none">
                                        <li>Knights are the pieces that move unlike any other piece on the 
                                            board. Their movement is limited to lines that continue straight 
                                            for 4 spaces and then one space to either their left of right, and 
                                            cannot move diagonally. The 
                                            unique aspect of this pieces is that it can 'jump' over other pieces 
                                            without taking them. The knight can only take a piece if it is in a 
                                            location where the knight will land. Each side starts with 2 knignts.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li><u>Bishops</u></li>
                                        <ul style="list-style: none">
                                            <li>A bishop is a piece that starts on the direct sides of the king and queen. 
                                                Bishops can only move and attack in diagonal 
                                                directions, but has the ability to move as many 
                                                spaces as it has avalible. Each side starts with 2 bishops.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <li><u>Rooks</u></li>
                                            <ul style="list-style: none">
                                                <li>The rooks are pieces that start in the corners of a players back 
                                                    row. A rook is very similar in movement to the bishop, in the sense 
                                                    that it can only more in horizontal and vertical directions, but 
                                                    also move as many spaces as it can in one turn. Each side starts with 2 rooks.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <li><u>Queen</u></li>
                                            <ul style="list-style: none">
                                                <li>The queen is the second most valuable piece, and starts next to the king. 
                                                    This piece has the combined abilities of the rook and the bishop, being 
                                                    able to move in any direction and as many spaces as there are avalible. Each side starts with 1 queen.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <li><u>King</u></li>
                                            <ul style="list-style: none">
                                                <li>The king is the most valuable piece on the board. The movement of the king is 
                                                    limited to one space in any direction. The king cannot be taken, rather put in a position 
                                                    where it is in the line of sight of an opponents piece and cannot escape it's current location. If the 
                                                    king is put in check (A state where it is in the range of an opponents piece) the player must use 
                                                    their turn to get the king out of the situation. If the king is trapped with no options to run, fight, 
                                                    or sacrifice another piece, then the opponent declares 'checkmate' and the game is over. Each side has 1 king.

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>When playing casually or competitivley, there are some rules that can be enforced 
                                if both sides agree that they are necessary. Here are some common rules that can 
                                be found among chessplayers;
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>If a player touches one of their pieces on their turn, they have to 
                                    move that exact piece.
                                </li>
                                <li>When playing with a press-timer, if a player does not hit the timer after completing their move, 
                                    it is still their turn and the other player cannot move until they press the timer.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p class="hobbytitle">Forfeiting & Draws</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>If a player believes that their situation will not get better, and see 
                                    no positive outcome, the player can knock their king over to declare a 
                                    forfeit from the game. In which, the other player will declared the 
                                    victor. Alternativley, if both players find that the game is taking too long 
                                    or more tedius that it is enjoyable, they can agree on a draw. In this 
                                    situation, both players forfeit the game, ending without a declared 
                                    winner. 
                                </p>
