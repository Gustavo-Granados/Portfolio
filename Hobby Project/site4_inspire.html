            <p>I've been hiking since I moved out to Arizona. The amount of paths and 
                trails out here allow for plenty of adventure to beautiful sights to 
                see. I was inspired to start hiking regularly by my mother, who has been 
                hiking for as long as I can remember. She always tried to get me out of the 
                house when we first moved here, with most of my hobbies being indoor 
                activities. I had a slow start to hiking, but after doing it for some time, 
                I can say that I thoroughly enjoy it now.
