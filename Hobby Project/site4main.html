            <p>
                    At the turn of the 20th century hiking for pleasure was a relatively new concept. America was largely rural until the mid-1800s, 
                    and most people lived near open fields and forests. Walking and nature were a part of daily life. With increasing industrialization during the 19th century, 
                    however, a walk in the woods would become a luxury for many people, 
                    and it wasnâ€™t until the end of that century that hiking was recognized as a recreational activity.
