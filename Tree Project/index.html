                We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:
                <br>* Unplug
                <br>* Interact
                <br>* Reconnect"

            <p>
                    And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones<br> 
                    that bring people together through shared experiences. With<br> 
                    all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get<br>
                    that from a computer screen. Sometimes you need the <br>
                    intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around <br>
                    a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.</p>
            <p>
                
                    We are a local board and card game store located in the<br>
                    heart of Morgantown near the campus. We carry <br>
                    hundreds of games and puzzles, including <br>
                    educational games, family games, card games, historical <br>
                    simulations, role-playing games, and so much more. <br>
                    If you remember a great game from your youth, we <br>
                    probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.
            </p>
            <p>
                    We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate <br>
                    gaming and the company of good friends. <br>
                    Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out <br>
                    a game from our demo library and start playing. <br>
                    We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special <br>
                    social events. You'll always find a game to play.
            </p>
            <p>
                    We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We <br>
                    publish periodic reviews of new titles. Just out <br>
                    our reviews of Towers and Temples and Alliance; both <br>
                    new this month at Harpe Gaming.
