                                                battling for supremacy you must lead your country's

                                                You have to form alliances and then betray your 
                                                allies before they betray you!

                                                 of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
                                                raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion

                                            "The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
                                            share similar features including the 
                                            formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
                                            through random draws of a deck or the 
                                            roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that 
                                            is new or innovative in that regard.
                                            
                                            We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
                                            In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
                                            reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
                                            playing the game. If you want to read a 
                                            book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu."</em>

                                            "Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the 
                                            game play to be robust and engaging. The 
                                            rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
                                            experience in this class of board games, there 
                                            is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
                                            think the battle simulation cards are some of 
                                            the best we have encountered.
                                            
                                            All of that being said, the competition for this type 
                                            of game is fierce. There are a lot of 
                                            established titles with loyal clients. We're not 
                                            exactly sure where Alliance fits in with 
                                            that group. It's a good game, but not good enough 
                                            to draw our attention away from games like 
                                            Battle Tested and Global Conflict."</em>
