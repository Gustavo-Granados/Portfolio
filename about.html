                      My name is Gustavo Granados, and I am an aspiring web-developer. I'm currently enrolled in the 
                      West-Mec North East Campus Coding Program, and have been using what I have learned to help create this Portfolio. 
                      This current design will be used as the first functional site that I will use to log my progress in understanding the tools 
                      avalible to me in this program.

                    I attend Boulder Creek Highschool as my home school, and attend my West-Mec program for my electives.
                    During my Freshman year of Highschool I was introduced to the FBLA, where I was able to gain some substancial 
                    knowlege on the inner-workings of the business aspect of web design.
                    To view my past assignments/designs for websites, the <a href="gallery.html">Portfolio</a> link holds a collection 
                    of some of my more recent developments.
