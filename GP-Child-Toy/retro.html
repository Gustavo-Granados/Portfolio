                Our History
                <p>
                    It has come a long way over the past almost 85 years - from a small carpenter’s workshop to a modern, global 
                    enterprise that is now one of the world’s largest manufacturers of toys.
                    The LEGO brick is our most important product. We are proud to have been named “Toy of the Century” twice. 
                    Our products have undergone extensive development over the years – but the foundation remains the traditional LEGO brick.
                     The brick in its present form was launched in 1958. The interlocking principle with its tubes makes it unique and offers unlimited building possibilities. 
                     It’s just a matter of getting the imagination going – and letting a wealth of creative ideas emerge through play.
